          Docker and Cloud9 and React! (oh my!)<br></br> <br></br>
          <b><i>DOCKER</i></b>
            <p>Docker allows  us to run our application in a container. A container is a type of lightweight VM where all packages and dependencies
                can be installed. it is a tool that allows the team to completely package software. We are currently utilizing it to make a container 
                that has all the tools needed to run Kubernetes on it, along with chaos libraries in it, such as Chaostoolkit and Pumba. 
            </p>
          <b><i>CLOUD 9</i></b>
          <p>Cloud 9 was chosen for the IDE in order to help circumvent some permissions issues. It allows for a more seamless integration into AWS environment.
              It provides an environment that is collaborative. It supposrts a variety of languages and some chaos tools relevant to the project.
          </p>
          <b><i>REACT</i></b>
          <p>Reactis a web application development framework that is written in JavaScript. In creating the dummy application in React, we are able to 
              easily deploy our app to AWS and apply our chaos engineering tests to this app. We also connected our application to the Google Firebase platform to easily connect 
              to an online database.
          </p>
          <b><i>FIREBASE</i></b>
          <p>Firbase is an online service by Google that allows developers to develop and deploy web and mobile applications without having to worry about managing 
              the infrastructure of the app. The team connected the app to the database of Firebase, opposed to AWS due to the familiarity of Firebase.
          </p>
          <b><i>KUBERNETES</i></b>
          <p>Discipline of experimenting on a software system in order to expose weaknesses and build resiliency in a system's ability to withstand unexpected consitions.
              It was started by Netflix when they were switching to cloud innfrastructure in 2011. Competing products include: Simian Army (open source,
              includes chaosmonkey), Gremlin, Pumba, Chaostoolkit, etc.
